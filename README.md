## Troubleshooting

### Widget doesn't appear in the add widgets menu
- Try restarting Plasma: `plasmashell --replace &`
- Check if the installation was successful: `kpackagetool6 -l | grep ChatQT`

### Can't connect to Ollama
- Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
- Check if Ollama is accessible: 
  - locally: `curl http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/tags` 
  - remotely: `curl http://{your-servers-ip}:11434/api/tags` 
- Verify the server URL in widget configuration

### No models available
- Make sure Ollama is running and accessible
- Check your server URL configuration  
- Verify models are installed: `ollama list`
- Restart the widget after downloading new models

### Input behavior not working as expected
- Check your configuration in "Appearance & Behavior" â†’ "Input behavior"
- Remember: Default mode uses Ctrl+Enter to send, Modern mode uses Enter to send

### Pin button not working
- Ensure you're using the latest version with the pin functionality fixes
- Try toggling the pin state a few times to refresh the behavior

### Performance issues during AI responses
- The latest version includes optimized streaming to prevent UI blocking
- If issues persist, check your network connection to the Ollama server
